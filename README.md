> This was a project I started back in 2022 about finding any information I could on these mysterious no-name chinese game consoles. After months of digging, I've found the only 2 sources of any information on (almost) my specific model. After countless hours spent translating outdated chinese and russians documents, this project has come to a close.

### **The Conclusion**

This cheap game console uses the same recycled x32 linus based OS as many diverse chinese products. Anything from radios to game consoles to car accesories use this same OS, with different apps.

The compilation process is still not completely understood, and thus making custom apps for this OS is yet to be done by anyone (As far as I can tell). Any error in the applications code immediantly reboots the OS.

As for firmware, it has been extensively reverse engineered. Unfortunately, my model was slightly different from those used in the Russian Blog, and using the many well developed tools there did not work for me.

Eventually I decided to flash a different OS version, and bricked my console. I was unable to download any data from the console and could not create any backups. Unless I find the right firmware version somewhere (Seller ignored me), it is bricked for good.

*A fun project, but I've moved on to others more important.*
